Analysis of Wine
I have been watching a number of documentaries on wine and the wine industry and I got to thinking. For as large and common wine is, it definitly feels like wine is more arcane sorcery than science. I was curious if I could apply skills that I had aquired over the last several years to find if there are any trends or bias. 

Because this is an initial foray into doing some analysis, I decided to try to find a dataset that would give me enough data to get my thoughts off the ground. 
Thankfully another individual, [Zack Thoutt]("https://github.com/zackthoutt/wine-deep-learning"), had already done the task of generating a dataset. 

This repository is where that I will be putting the results various analyses I perform.
